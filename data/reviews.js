      "First of all, thanks for organizing such an interesting event online. As someone who is a bit too curious about murder, crime and criminal psychology in general, this was a surreal experience. The organizers were helpful and cooperative,  the situations we were presented were interesting to say the least. This has been great fun for all of us and we look forward for many more such fascinating events in the future.",
